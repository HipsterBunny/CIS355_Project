* Just FYI. for the carousel, I added a page that has not been created called
  'newProducts.php' which will basically be exactly the same as 'products.php'
  exept that the SQL query will be altered to find a slightly different version
  of products.

  In the products table, there are two fields that we need for this, one holds the month the item
  was added and the other holds the year that the item was added.  For the 
  'newProducts.php' page we will want to check to see what the current month 
  and year is and probably just populate it with the items from the last and 
  current month.

  If you would like to do something else let me know.

  As previously stated, It will be almost exactly the same as the 
  'products.php' page, but holding different products due to the modified SQL query.
