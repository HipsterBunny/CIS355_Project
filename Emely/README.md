For the how putting stuff in Databases, this was 
a pretty sweet thing to read up on.  I know it's not 100% 
relevant, but it's cool.

I haven't really done that much for the project

I was thinking we could use Twitter Bootstrap for the 
basic JS and css because Hallouche basically wants to 
see that we have an ability to manipulate PHP and 
Databases.

If you want to do your normal form magic on the database
feel free too.

I'm actually having a bit of difficulty remembering how
to assign FK's in phpmyadmin so if anybody wants to show
me - I would be really into that.

All in all I think that for displaying the products we should
just have one script that (after product ID is posted)
will populate with that product info from the database.

Let me know what you guys are thinking, I know we still have the
paypal stuff to add, as well as the user login and comment section.

I still don't feel like the user comments will be even remotely
difficult - but to be honest I can't remember which part 
of the project each of us said we would do.

Doop Doop. Dat's a lot of words
